# Fraud_Detection
A Hybrid Deep Learning Model which uses Self Organizing Maps (SOM) to detect frauds in the dataset (Unsupervised Learning)and later uses ANN to find the probability of fraud (Supervised Learning) for each customer.

A dataset is given of different bank clients on the basis of which we need to detect frauds clients which are basically outliers in the dataset and are easily identified by SOM (Unsupervised Learning Algorithm).

After Frauds are detected, on their basis of information, each customer's probability of cheating(fraud) is calculated using Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Supervised Learning Algorithm.

Tools Used: Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-Learn, MiniSom, Pylab, Tensorflow, Keras.
